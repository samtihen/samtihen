### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Lead Software Engineer at Enterprise Holdings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samtihen/), where I have worked since 2015. I completed a MS in CS at the University of Missouri - Saint Louis in 2022, with an emphasis in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

I'm passionate about building software of all types, and really enjoy teaching and mentoring newer developers.

I really enjoy [traveling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9Ko-yvJzHU), and was lucky enough to spend my late 20s abroad while working on a [Scuba Diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j4-ncvzolA) startup called [MyScubaDives.com](http://www.myscubadives.com).

Today, I am [married to my high school crush and have two young children](https://www.flickr.com/people/samtihen/) who take up most of my free time.
